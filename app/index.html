                                <p> Giving your pet pooch a much-needed bath can do a lot more than just maintaining
                                    its hygiene and health. It can also be a great way to manage and control common pest
                                    problems like fleas and ticks while also strengthening the bond between you and your mutt. It

                            <h4 class="main-title">Why Use Dog Shampoos and Not Human Products?</h4>
                            <div class="blog-txt">
                                <p>Here’s the thing about pet care products – there’s just way too many of them that you
                                    simply
                                    don’t know which ones are really essential and which ones you can do without.
                                    Unfortunately,
                                    many pet owners don’t think a dedicated pet shampoo is necessary and that their
                                    human
                                    shampoos
                                    should already suffice. This is a very common occurrence especially among
                                    individuals
                                    who simply
                                    fail to realize the important <span>difference betwen human and dog skin </span> as this is where
                                    the
                                    issue
                                    whether it is safe to use ordinary human shampoo on dogs or not.
                                </p>
                                <h6>• The Acid Mantle</h6>
                                <p>Consider the acid mantle as a natural barrier between the external environment and
                                    the
                                    different structures
                                    of the skin. The outermost layer of skin is actually a collection of epithelial
                                    cells in
                                    various
                                    stages of cornification or hardening. The innermost layers are fresher and softer
                                    while
                                    the
                                    layer that we see on our skin is actually made of cornified tissues. That is why
                                    this is
                                    called
                                    stratum corneum.</p>
                                <p> Given the fact that the stratum corneum is made up of hardened skin cells, it
                                    would be safe to assume that this is enough to afford us or our dogs the protection
                                    we
                                    need
                                    against external threats. Unfortunately, this is far from the truth. These hardened
                                    skin
                                    cells
                                    can still be attacked by bacteria and viruses that can enter through the rest of the
                                    skin layers
                                    if there’s a cut or opening in the skin.</p>
                                <p>As such, as a supporting mechanism to this primary
                                    defense barrier, the body also produces a very thin layer that experts call as the
                                    acid
                                    mantle.
                                    The acid mantle keeps microbial contaminants from invading the skin by providing an
                                    acid
                                    environment which will help neutralize these microorganisms. Moreover, the acid
                                    mantle
                                    helps
                                    reduce the rate of evaporation and facilitates the more efficient absorption of
                                    water to
                                    keep
                                    the skin well-hydrated.</p>
                                <p>When we take a bath, this thin protective layer is inadvertently washed
                                    away. That is why many of the bath soaps and shampoos that we use contain
                                    ingredients
                                    that will
                                    help blanket the skin while it is in the process of renewing its acid mantle. These
                                    products
                                    also help to moisturize the skin.</p>
                                <p>So, the acid mantle is a very important protective layer of
                                    the skin. Its effectiveness is dependent on the correct balance of acids and bases
                                    on
                                    the skin.
                                    You know this as pH balance.</p>
                                <p>Here is where the main difference lies and one of the fundamental
                                    reasons why you cannot use human shampoo on your pet.</p>
                                <p>The normal pH of human skin is slightly
                                    more acidic, typically ranging between 5.2 and 6.2. You should know that the normal
                                    pH of the human blood is between 7.35 and 7.45, which is slightly alkaline, if we take the
                                    conventional pH standardization of 7.0 as being neutral. Your dog, on the other hand, typically has
                                    a normal skin pH of 6.2 to 7.4 which is more on the alkaline side.</p></p> Using ordinary human
                                shampoos on dogs can substantially disrupt their acid mantle. This leaves your mutt especially vulnerable
                                to microbial invasion such as bacteria, viruses, and even parasites. Not only that, because
                                the moisture from their skin has been essentially stripped away, they develop dry and flaky
                                skin. This can be especially itchy, leading to incessant scratching and potentially cutting up
                                the kin. As we have already said, any loss in the integrity of the skin will result in the
                                entry of pathogenic microorganisms.</p>
                                <p>That said, you should never use your own shampoo on your mutt
                                    regardless of how ‘mild’ these products are formulated.</p>
                                <h6>• Skin Sensitivity</h6>
                                <p>We did mention that our outer layer of our skin is actually composed of several
                                    sub-layers; 5 to be exact. When
                                    taken together, you are looking at a 10 to 15 rows of skin cells. On the other hand,
                                    our
                                    canine
                                    friends only have 3 to 5 rows of skin cells.</p>
                                <p>Because their skin is essentially ‘thinner’ than
                                    ours, using hair wash products that contain harsh chemicals or ingredients can
                                    easily
                                    erode
                                    these layers. Again, this leads to skin rashes, drying, flaking, and even intense
                                    itching, which
                                    you already know what happens next.</p>
                                <p>Now you might think that this is bull since dogs can easily
                                    go anywhere without hurting or damaging their skin. This is where their coat comes
                                    in.
                                    Unlike
                                    the hair follicles in humans that grow as individual hair, the hair follicles in
                                    canines
                                    typically grow in clusters, providing ample protection for the skin beneath it.
                                    Unfortunately,
                                    if they do get a bath, moisture can easily get under this cluster of hair follicles,
                                    somehow
                                    trapping them in the process. This is also one of the reasons why it is a lot more
                                    difficult to
                                    dry their hairs after getting wet.</p>
                                <p>Giving your mutt a bath using your shampoo can lead to more
                                    severe skin irritation primarily because they have more sensitive skin.</p>
                                <p>Should you use your own
                                    shampoo on your dog? The straightforward answer is ‘NO’. If you’re not convinced,
                                    try
                                    bathing
                                    your mutt with your own hair wash product and you will see that the odor is not at
                                    all
                                    that
                                    pleasant. Many pet owners tend to repeat the washing believing that doing so will
                                    help
                                    remove
                                    the nasty smell. Unfortunately, it only gets worse because the acid mantle has
                                    already
                                    been
                                    severely disrupted and bacteria are already wreaking havoc on your pet’s skin. If
                                    you
                                    don’t mind
                                    the smell, sooner or later your mutt will be scratching incessantly and you’ll be
                                    wondering if
                                    it has fleas or ticks. Sadly, most pet owners will never think that it is their
                                    pet’s
                                    use of
                                    human shampoo that is causing the itching.</p>
